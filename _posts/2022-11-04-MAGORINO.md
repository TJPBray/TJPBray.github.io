<h1> What is the problem? </h1>
MRI is a powerful method that can provide incredibly detailed information about biological tissues. However, in order to interpret this information accurately, we need to be able to 'disentangle' the information that comes from different tissue compartments. For example, when tissues contain both water and fat, the MRI signal coming from these two 'species' is added together. In order to interpret the signal correctly, we need to **separate** the information coming from these tissues. 

<h1> How can computational MRI help? </h1>
Computational MRI can help us to separate out the signals coming from different 'species', such as water and fat. We do this by first **acquiring signal measurements at multiple different times** in the MRI experiment. The way that the signal behaves over these acquisitions with different timings depends on the proportion of water and fat. 

To determine precisely how much water and how much fat is present, we use an algorithm which finds combinations of tissue **parameters** that make the observed **signal measurements** most likely:

**Figure 1 - Finding the most likely solution.** In a water-dominant voxel (a), the true (low fat fraction) solution can be identified on the basis that it has a higher likelihood than the alternative, high fat fraction solution. In a fat-dominant voxel (b), the true (high fat fraction) solution can be identified on the basis that it has a higher likelihood than the alternative, low fat fraction solution.

<h1> What are the limitations of existing methods? </h1>
One of the key difficulties is that the MRI signal does not only come from water and fat, but is also contaminated by **noise**, which is an unwanted, random error in the signal. If unaccounted for, this noise dictates that the **apparent** most likely solution does not always correspond to the true solution. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as **swapping**, causes **bias and imprecision** in our assessments of tissue properties, reducing the value of the measurement for scientific and clinical purposes.

**Figure 2 - Failure of existing methods in the presence of noise.** In this example of a truly water dominant voxel, the true (low fat fraction solution) has a lower likelihood than the incorrect, high fat fraction solution, leading to selection of the wrong optimum. 

<h1> How do we propose to address this? </h1>
To address these issues, we propose an algorithm known as MAGORINO (**Mag**nitude-**O**nly PDFF and R2* estimation with **Ri**cian **No**ise modelling). With MAGORINO, we use a mathematical model of the noise in the signal, such that the more likely solution does in fact correspond to the ground truth solution in a greater proportion of cases: we achieve the situation in Figure 1 (rather than the situation in Figure 2) with greater frequency.

**Figure 2 - Improvement in selection of correct optimum with MAGORINO.** The histograms show the frequency with which different proton density fat fraction (PDFF) estimates are chosen. Ideally, the estimates should lie close to the ground truth (red line). With the conventional method (left), a large number of the estimates are incorrect (swapped). With MAGORINO, the large majority of the estimates lie close to the ground truth, producing a substantial reduction in bias. 



MAGORINO enables measurement of two key markers of tissue propoerties - the fat fraction (FF), which describes how much fat is present in the tissue, and R2*, a parameter which describes how quickly the MRI signal decays and is sensitive to tissue iron and calcium content. It uses a mathematical model of the noise in the signal in order to correct for noise in the measurement, making the estimates of tissue proprties robust to the level of noise. Crucially, MAGORINO uses data which is easily available from any scanner, without the need for specialist software or research agreements, making it possible to implement across the NHS. Both of these features should make MAGORINO-based measurements more reliable across different scanners, and offer a promising route to widespread translation across the NHS.
