<h1> What is the problem? </h1>
MRI is a powerful method that can provide incredibly detailed information about biological tissues. However, in order to interpret this information accurately, we need to be able to 'disentangle' the information that comes from different tissue compartments. For example, when tissues contain both water and fat, the MRI signal coming from these two 'species' is added together. In order to interpret the signal correctly, we need to **separate** the information coming from these tissues. 

<h1> How can computational MRI help? </h1>
Computational MRI can help us to separate out the signals coming from different 'species', such as water and fat. We do this by first **acquiring signal measurements at multiple different times** in the MRI experiment. The way that the signal behaves over these acquisitions with different timings depends on the proportion of water and fat. To determine precisely how much water and how much fat is present, we use an algorithm which finds combinations of tissue **parameters** that make the observed **signal measurmeents** most likely:

<h1> What are the limitations of existing methods? </h1>
One of the key difficulties is that the MRI signal does not only come from water and fat, but is also contaminated by **noise**, which is an unwanted, random error in the signal. If unaccounted for, this noise causes **bias and imprecision** in our assessments of tissue properties, reducing the value of the measurement for scientific and clinical purposes. 

<h1> How do we propose to address this? </h1>
To address these issues, we propose an algorithm known as MAGORINO (**Mag**nitude-**O**nly PDFF and R2* estimation with **Ri**cian **No**ise modelling). 

MAGORINO enables measurement of two key markers of tissue propoerties - the fat fraction (FF), which describes how much fat is present in the tissue, and R2*, a parameter which describes how quickly the MRI signal decays and is sensitive to tissue iron and calcium content. It uses a mathematical model of the noise in the signal in order to correct for noise in the measurement, making the estimates of tissue proprties robust to the level of noise. Crucially, MAGORINO uses data which is easily available from any scanner, without the need for specialist software or research agreements, making it possible to implement across the NHS. Both of these features should make MAGORINO-based measurements more reliable across different scanners, and offer a promising route to widespread translation across the NHS.
