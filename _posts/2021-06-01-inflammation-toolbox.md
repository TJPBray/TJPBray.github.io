## An AI-powered toolbox for imaging inflammation - a proposal

<h1> An AI-powered toolbox for imaging inflammation - a proposal </h1>
One of the central problems in the assessment of inflammatory diseases is the current subjectivity and imprecision in assessments of inflammation and damage with imaging. This limits our ability to identify, characterise and monitor inflammation and damage and to tailor treatment accordingly in clinical practice. To address this, I am developing a Toolbox enabling Quantitative, Intelligent Imaging of Inflammation and Damage in the skeleton: the Q3ID Toolbox. The complete Toolbox will comprise a set of user-friendly tools, underpinned by advanced methods for acquisition and analysis of MRI scans (compatible with any modern scanner), providing quantitative, numerical measures of inflammation and damage. These measures will enable doctors to give the right treatment at the right time, supporting a precise, objective approach to treatment decision-making.
