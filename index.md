<h1> About me </h1>
I am an MRI researcher and Consultant Radiologist, based between the Centre for Medical Imaging at University College and the Imaging department at University College London Hospital. My core expertise is in the technical development and clinical translation of new methods for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly quantitative MRI (qMRI). I am particularly interested in the use of qMRI to characterise inflammation, a fundamental biological process which has - thus far - been understudied with imaging. By working at the interface of radiology, engineering and rheumatology, I aim to improve our capability to understand, diagnose and treat inflammatory diseases across organ systems.
